- **Contribute to Achievement**:
  - Participants can contribute tokens towards the community goal, with contributions tracked and reflected in the total contribution.

## Future Scope

1. **Milestone-Based Rewards**:

   - Implement rewards for participants when certain contribution milestones are reached, encouraging ongoing participation.

2. **Contribution Verification**:

   - Introduce a system to verify and validate contributions, ensuring transparency and fairness in the process.

3. **Multi-Goal Support**:
