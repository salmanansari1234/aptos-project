This contract fosters collective efforts and recognizes the contributions of each participant in achieving community milestones.

## Features

- **Mint Achievement Token**:
  - Users can mint a community achievement token with a unique ID and description, representing a community goal.
- **Contribute to Achievement**:
  - Participants can contribute tokens towards the community goal, with contributions tracked and reflected in the total contribution.

## Future Scope

1. **Milestone-Based Rewards**:

   - Implement rewards for participants when certain contribution milestones are reached, encouraging ongoing participation.

2. **Contribution Verification**:

   - Introduce a system to verify and validate contributions, ensuring transparency and fairness in the process.

3. **Multi-Goal Support**:
   - Allow communities to create and manage multiple achievement tokens simultaneously, fostering engagement across different initiatives.

The **CommunityAchievements** contract empowers communities to collaborate towards shared goals, while recognizing and rewarding individual contributions in a transparent and decentralized manner.
